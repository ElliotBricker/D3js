		//  the selection is no longer empty (it has one circle already), so the data is bound to the existing circle
		//   so there are no placeholders for data elements that have no corresponding DOM elements (that is
		//  what the enter() does.

		//    in this subsection of lession 7, the number of DOM elements is greater than the number
		//    of data elements (which is one).
